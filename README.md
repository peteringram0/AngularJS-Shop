AngularJS-Shop
==============

This is an independent plugin for AngularJS that adds shop and cart functionality to an existing AngularJS application. This plugin is based on AngularJS & Foundation CSS.

<b>Requirments:</b>
<ul>
  <li>AngualrJS v1.2.15 (http://angularjs.org/)</li>
  <li>Zurb Foundation v5 (http://foundation.zurb.com)</li>
</ul>

Due to the growing popularity in AngualrJS i have decided to start this project. This project will aim to create a plugin that can be included in any existing angularJS applicatio providing shop functionality.

This project is currently in beta stages. Anyone who wishes to contribute to this project is very welcome.
